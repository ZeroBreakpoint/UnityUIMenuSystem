# UnityUIMenuSystem

A simple main menu UI system created in Unity, designed for showcasing my core UI programming skills.

**Features**
- A custom main menu scene with background image and layout
- Play button that loads the game scene (SampleScene)
- Exit button that quits the application (or exits Play mode in editor)
- Scales cleanly to all screen resolutions using Unity's Canvas Scaler

Built as a compact demonstration of my UI implementation using Unity’s inspector-based workflow.
