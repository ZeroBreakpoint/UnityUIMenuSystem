# UnityUIMenuSystem

A simple main menu UI system created in Unity, designed to showcase my core UI programming skills.

**Features:**
- A custom main menu scene with background image and layout
- Play button that loads the game scene (SampleScene)
- Exit button that quits the application (or exits Play mode in editor)
- Scales cleanly to all screen resolutions using Unity's Canvas Scaler


**How to open the Unity project:**

- Open Unity Hub
- Click “Add Project”
- Navigate to the root folder of this cloned repo.
- Click “Select Folder”, ensure to select the below folders from this repo:

A copy of the Standalone .exe has also been included in this repository.

Unity should recognise it as a valid project and open it automatically.
