# UnityUIMenuSystem

A simple main menu UI system created in Unity, designed for showcasing my core UI programming skills.

A custom main menu scene with background image and layout

Play button that loads the game scene (SampleScene)

Exit button that quits the application (or exits Play mode in editor)

Smooth fade-in/fade-out scene transitions

Scales cleanly to all screen resolutions using Unity's Canvas Scaler

Built as a compact demonstration of my UI implementation using Unity’s inspector-based workflow — no complex scripting or third-party assets required.
